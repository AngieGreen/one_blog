            <p class="lead">I wrote my first line of computer code on January 26, 2015, as part of the Tech Talent South code school class. </p>
            <p>Eight weeks later, I 'graduated' with just enough Ruby on Rails knowledge to be dangerous.</p>
            <p>To keep learning, I'm creating 52 apps, websites, or projects over the next year (or so), with a focus on improving my skills.</p>
            <p>Each week I'll have <%= link_to "a different goal", goals_path %>, such as learning to write unit tests, or using Grunt, or contributing to someone else's open source project. </p>
            <p>And each week I'll post on this blog what I'm learning. </p>
            <p>This project was inspired by Jennifer Dewalt's <a href="http://blog.jenniferdewalt.com">180 Websites in 180 Days project</a></p>
